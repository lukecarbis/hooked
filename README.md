Hooked!
======================

Habit forming products and services change the behaviour of our clients, and increase their engagement with our business.

Habits:
* Increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
* Provide pricing flexibility
* Supercharge growth
* Sharpen your competitive edge (clients irrationally overvalue the old over the new)

This talk, based on the book [Hooked](http://www.hookmodel.com/) by Nir Eyal, will help you retain and engage your customers through habit formation.
